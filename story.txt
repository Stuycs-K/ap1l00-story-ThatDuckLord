Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having little or no bucks
in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on the world wide web, I thought I would <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> about
a little and see the <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> part of the area. It is a way I have of driving off the 
road and regulating circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the state of my life;
whenever it is a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>, <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE> November in my apartment complex; whenever I find myself involuntarily
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> before coffin grounds, and bringing up the rear of every car I meet; and
especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a <REPLACE_THIS_ADJECTIVE>
moral principle to prevent me from deliberately <REPLACE_THIS_VERB> into the jail, and methodically
<REPLACE_THIS_VERB> people's moods off—then, I account it high time to get to life as soon as I can.
There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all criminals in their degree,
some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the world with me.
